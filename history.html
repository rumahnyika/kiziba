<!-- Origins and Establishment -->
<section class="content-section">
  <h2>Origins and Establishment</h2>
  <p>
    The Kiziba Kingdom was a precolonial monarchy of the Haya people, located in what is now the Kagera Region of northwestern Tanzania, near Lake Victoria, with influence extending into southwestern Uganda. It emerged in the 1400s as one of several Haya kingdoms, including Karagwe, Ihangiro, Kihanja, Bukara, Lesser Kyamtwara, Bugabo, and Missenye.
  </p>
  <p>
    Kiziba was part of the Great Lakes Kingdoms. Unlike its neighbor, the Karagwe Kingdom, which was ruled by monarchs of the Hinda clan, Kiziba‚Äôs rulers belonged to the Bito (Babiito) clan, which also governed the Bunyoro Kingdom in Uganda. This made Kiziba distinct and closely linked with Bunyoro culturally and politically.

  <h2>Political Structure and Key Rulers</h2>
  <p>
    The kings of Kiziba, titled <strong>Omukama</strong>, held significant power. King Mutahangarwa (1903‚Äì1916) was especially pivotal, commissioning the historical documentation of the kingdom through oral tradition. The result was the 1949 Kihaya-language book <em>Amakuru Ga Kiziba na Abakama Bamu</em>, a foundational text in Kiziba historiography.
